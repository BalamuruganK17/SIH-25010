## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
A Smart Crop Advisory System for small and marginal farmers is a transformative solution designed to enhance agricultural productivity, sustainability, and income through personalized, data-driven guidance. The system begins by profiling each farmer based on landholding size, location, soil type, water availability, and cropping history, enabling tailored recommendations. It integrates real-time soil and weather intelligence using satellite data and local sensors to provide insights on moisture levels, nutrient status, rainfall forecasts, and pest risks. An AI-powered crop recommendation engine suggests the most suitable crops for the season, including high-yield and climate-resilient varieties, while also advising on crop rotation and intercropping strategies. Smart irrigation and fertilizer advisories optimize input use by recommending precise schedules and dosages based on crop stage and environmental conditions. The system also includes pest and disease management tools that use image recognition and regional outbreak data to deliver timely alerts and treatment options. To improve market access, it offers daily price updates, demand forecasts, and buyer connections, helping farmers make informed selling decisions. The advisory is delivered through a multilingual mobile app and IVR system to ensure accessibility for farmers with limited digital literacy. Community features like farmer forums and expert Q&A foster peer learning and local knowledge exchange. Built on a robust tech stack involving AI, cloud computing, and mobile platforms, the system engages stakeholders such as agricultural universities, government agencies, NGOs, and private AgriTech firms for validation, outreach, and scale-up. With phased implementation starting from pilot districts to full-scale deployment, the system aims to increase yields, reduce input costs, and build climate resilience, ultimately empowering smallholders with the tools they need to thrive in modern agriculture.


## Technical Approach
The Smart Crop Advisory System will be built using a combination of modern technologies and a phased implementation strategy. Core programming languages like Python and JavaScript (Node.js) will power the backend and AI models, while React Native will be used for developing a multilingual mobile app. Cloud platforms such as AWS or Firebase will handle data storage, real-time updates, and scalability. AI/ML frameworks like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn will support crop prediction, pest detection, and irrigation scheduling, while OpenCV will enable image-based disease recognition. Hardware components include IoT sensors for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, along with low-cost devices like Raspberry Pi or Arduino for field deployment. The implementation process begins with farmer profiling and infrastructure setup, followed by data integration from weather APIs, soil databases, and satellite feeds. Once AI models are trained and validated, advisory services are delivered via mobile and IVR platforms. Continuous feedback from farmers helps refine the system, and partnerships with local institutions ensure scalability and sustainability.

## Feasibility and Viability
The Smart Crop Advisory System is highly feasible and viable, especially in regions like Tamil Nadu where small and marginal farmers face unpredictable weather, limited access to expert guidance, and fluctuating market prices. With increasing smartphone penetration and government support for digital agriculture, deploying mobile-based advisory platforms is both practical and scalable. However, challenges include low digital literacy, inconsistent internet connectivity, and reluctance to adopt new technologies. There’s also the risk of inaccurate data inputs and over-reliance on automated recommendations. To overcome these, the system should include voice-based interfaces in local languages, offline functionality, and regular field validation by agricultural extension officers. Training programs, community engagement, and partnerships with local NGOs can build trust and ensure adoption. By combining technology with human support, the system can become a reliable tool for improving crop decisions and farmer livelihoods.

## Impact and Benefits
The Smart Crop Advisory System can significantly uplift small and marginal farmers by providing timely, personalized guidance that improves crop choices, input efficiency, and market decisions. With easy access to weather forecasts, soil health insights, and pest alerts, farmers can reduce crop failure and increase yields. The system also empowers them with market price updates and selling strategies, helping boost income and reduce dependency on middlemen. By delivering advice in local languages through mobile apps and voice calls, it bridges the digital divide and ensures inclusivity. Overall, it enhances productivity, resilience, and confidence among farmers, transforming agriculture into a more informed and profitable livelihood.
## Research and References
Several research studies support the feasibility and impact of Smart Crop Advisory Systems for small and marginal farmers. For instance, the AI–Driven Crop Advisory System by Gaviya et al. demonstrates how geospatial data and government schemes can be integrated to guide crop selection. Similarly, Shyamrao Gade’s work on IoT and machine learning shows how real-time sensor data can forecast crop health and weather risks. Another study by Vishwakarma and Vaishya highlights the role of AI platforms in delivering multilingual, real-time advice using satellite imagery and climate models. These references confirm that combining AI, IoT, and local language support can significantly improve decision-making, productivity, and resilience in agriculture.
